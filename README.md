Hi, I'm Aye. I'm just learning and practicing.

Here goes a excerpt from my favorite's song: 
The moon holds the light and the moon's this spinning globe. 
Shedding light upon the road.
The bird won't fly.
And a bird without its wings is a low and tragic thing. 
We are ghosts amongst these hills. McMorrow

See you :)*
